# Sorting_visualizer
Tried to build a webpage that facilitates the visualization of different sorting algorithms, namely QuickSort, MergeSort, SelectionSort, InsertioinSort, BubbleSort and HeapSort.
You can adjust the speed of the visualization and the size of the array by the provided slider.
The "Generate New Array" as the name suggest generates a completely new and random array of numbers.
You can choose any of the provided sorting algorithm button to visualize its execution.
It also shows the Space and Time complexity of the chosen Sorting algorithm during runtime.
Note: The buttons wont be accesible while the algorithm is running.
